# Component Connection Method
The Component Connection Method (CCM) composes a single small-signal model from predefined and interconnected dynamical systems in state space.

# Python and MS Excel-based implementation
Because of the increasing demand for small-signal models (SSMs) compatible with Python from transmission system operators [1], and a practical need for a tabular editing view, the CCM code is written in Python and uses MS Excel for saving the dynamical systems. 

# Purpose


# Usage
## Research and development purposes
If you are using the code for research, you are required to cite the paper [2].

## Industry and commerial purposes
....

# Future work
- Data encryption of composed SSMs using the CCM.
- Flexibility in nesting the CCM and composing SSMs hierarchical.
